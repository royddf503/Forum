# Forum

Welcome to my forum website!

My forum is a platform where users can create and participate in discussions on various topics.

Here are some of the features of my forum:

Homepage: The homepage displays a list of all the latest discussions on the forum. You can also search for specific discussions using the search bar.

Accounts: Every user on the forum has their own account, which they can access by clicking on the "My Account" button on the top right of the homepage. From the account page, you can view your profile, change your password, and see all the discussions you have participated in.

Login: To access your account or participate in discussions, you will need to login to the forum. Simply click on the "Login" button on the top right of the homepage and enter your username and password.

Uploading new posts: To start a new discussion on the forum, click on the "New Post" button on the top right of the homepage. You can then enter a title and the body of your discussion and choose a category for it.

Signup: If you don't have an account on the forum yet, you can create one by clicking on the "Signup" button on the top right of the homepage. You will need to enter your email, username, and password to complete the signup process.

Like: You can "like" a discussion by clicking on the "Like" button under the discussion. This helps other users see which discussions are popular on the forum.

Delete: If you are the owner of a discussion, you can delete it by clicking on the "Delete" button under the discussion. Please note that this action is permanent and cannot be undone.

Edit: If you are the owner of a discussion, you can edit the title and body of the discussion by clicking on the "Edit" button under the discussion.

In addition to the features described above, our forum also includes an advanced analysis tool that uses a sentiment model to analyze the posts of each user. This model goes through the posts of each user and determines their average sentiment, which can be either negative, neutral, or positive.

Using this analysis, we can gain insights into the overall sentiment of our users and how it changes over time. This can be useful for understanding the tone of discussions on the forum and for identifying any trends or patterns in the way that users express themselves.

To access this feature, simply run "data_preprocessing". This will display each user average sentiment according to their posts. You can use this information to gain a better understanding of your users and to improve the overall experience on the forum.
